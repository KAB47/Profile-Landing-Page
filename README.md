Seeking a Role in Technology

I am passionate about coding and technology, and have a particular interest on open-source projects. I bring competencies in Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, Flask, Postman, Azure, and React.

I have completed projects focused on both backend and frontend engineering, including a Bookstore API(Application Programming Interface), a Crypto-Trading application, and a booking website.

Having undertaken software engineering internships, I aim to apply my experience and knowledge in a new role, increase my knowledge base and give my best to a role.

In addition, I have experience in marketing, SEO, content creation, research, administration, product design, and mechanical engineering.
